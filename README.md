## Status: Discontinued / Frozen. Don't use the current version!
### A powerfull AntiCheat software made to detect unfair gamplay advantages.<br>A re-write of this Plugin is planned to solve problems resulting from very poor software architecture in the current versions. The re-write progress can be seen in the following repository: https://github.com/DarkWav/SAC-rewrite . Once the re-write is finished, I will publish it to the main repository, but it could take several months to complete. This version of SAC will not recieve any feature-updates any more, bug fixes for existing bugs will be published until the official release of the re-write.
