#---------------------# KillAura #----------------------#
#Probaby the best part of this plugin.
#Do you want to enable KillAura check?
#This also catches AimAura and KillAuraLegit.
#This will block anything that gives the player
#a sanificant gamplay advantage, not useless bots.
#TP-Aura is handled by Speed. This is purely behavoir
#based, it does not spawn any fake entities.
#While some components of AntiKillAura might
#immediately take action upon violation,
#others are sneaky and will suddenly cause a kick.

   KillAura: true

#Angle (3rd-person-pvp prevention)
#This will block hitting with impossible angles.
#(blocks hitting behind yourself)
#This is pretty basic and will not cause false
#positives or false alerts.
#This also communicates with Heuristics. (Even when disabled.)
#This check immediately takes action upon violation.
#Do you want to enable Angle?

   Angle: true

#Minimum check distance
#How many blocks must 2 Players be away from each
#other to be violated for angle if they hit with more
#than 180 degrees angle?.
#NEVER set this lower than 1.0!

#How far must a player hit in order to be violated immediately?

   ViolationRange: 4.5

#Advanced KillAura Heuristics And Detection
#This is an advanced algorithm to catch a lot more
#combat hacks. This is generally aggersive, but
#you can make it even more aggressive or rather
#permissive, but i recommend leaving it as it is.
#This check is sneaky. It will suddenly kick the
#hacker without any warning or hit canceling before.
#How strong should Heuristics be configured?
#
# 0 = DISABLE
# 1 = PERMISSIVE
# 2 = NORMAL (Default)
# 3 = AGGRESSIVE
#
# PREMISSIVE will cause close to zero false positives
# even on large servers, but detection is slow and
# bypasses are more likely.
#
# NORMAL will catch most KillAuras, with a very little
# chanche of both false positives and negatives.
# I would recommand this setting because it is the most
# efficent and has the most usability.
#
# AGGRESSIVE will catch nearly every KillAura very fast,
# even some triggerbots are detected. This configuration is
# very agressive and may cause false positives depending
# on the situation. If you set "KillAura-Threshold" to
# at least 50 it can be very effective. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
#
#I reccomand to use PERMISSIVE if you have a big server.
#For other servers, use NORMAL for a normal server , only
#use AGGRESSIVE if you have a smaller server or need
#really fast detection. Use high thresholds for this.

   Heuristics: 2

#DeepHeuristics (Triggerbot/Advanced Aura Detection)
#This catches combat hacks that actually aim 
#on a Player. Disabeling this could make the check
#pretty easy to bypass.
#This check is sneaky. It will suddenly kick the
#hacker without any warning or hit canceling before.
#Advanced behavorial analysis of a players combat.
#This is a component of Heuristics you can configure.
#This will NOT work if Heuristics are disabled!
#
# 0 = DISABLE
# 1 = PERMISSIVE
# 2 = NORMAL (Default)
# 3 = AGGRESSIVE
#
# PERMISSIVE and NORMAL will catch some Macros and helps the KillAura
# Check to perform better. Generally NORMAL catches more hacks whilst
# PERMISSIVE gives almost zero False Alarms, it is still your choice.
# Works best with Heuristics set to PREMISSIVE or NORMAL.
#
# AGGRESSIVE is pretty paranoid and will catch nearly every combat hack in existance,
# but should be used with high thresholds. False Alarms much more likely.
# Works best with Heuristics set to AGGRESSIVE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
#
#I would recommend to use AGGRESSIVE for fast detection,
#for any other case use NORMAL.
#Only use PERMISSIVE if you get False Detections with NORMAL.

   DeepHeuristics: 2

#FastClick
#This kicks players that hit more
#than a specific amount of times per second
#It will block too fast hit speeds.
#This check is sneaky. It will suddenly kick the
#hacker without any warning or hit canceling before.

   FastClick: true

#How many hits per second should players be allowed to get?
#Higher this if false positives occur.

   MaxCPS: 12

#How many times must a player hack before detection?
#35 Should work fine. (Standard)
#NEVER set this lower than 25
#Suitable settings:
#For PREMISSIVE Heuristics: 10-30 (I would reccomend about 20)
#For   NORMAL   Heuristics: 30-50 (I would reccomend about 40)
#For AGGRESSIVE Heuristics: 50-70 (I would reccomend about 60)
#Increase if KillAura causes false poitives.

   Speed: true

#Wich Punishment should take place?

#How much Range may a player have to be legit?
#This will support the KillAura Checks if enabled.
#Maxrange will be the maximum range.
#Players are not kicked for that due to
#False Positives.
#It simply mitigates an exploit in the game.
#Standard: 4.0
#NEVER set this to lower than 1

#----------------------# Glide #------------------------#
