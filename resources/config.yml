#-------------------Fly-------------------#
#Do you want to enable Fly check?
#This wont have any problems with falling or jumping,
#even if the player has JumpBoost 2.
#This has beem re-written in 3.1.0 and
#takes care of NoDownlGlide.

   Fly: true

#How many moves may a player be flying before detection?
#15 Should work fine. (Standard)
#NEVER set this lower than 10
#Increase if Fly causes false poitives.

   Fly-Threshold: 15

#----------------KillAura-----------------#
#BETA, REPORT BUGS!
#Do you want to enable KillAura check?
#This also catches AimAura and KillAuraLegit.
#This will block anything that gives the player
#a sanificant gamplay advantage, not useless bots.
#TP-Aura is handled by Speed. This is purely behavoir
#based, it does not spawn any fake entities.

   KillAura: true

#Angle (3rd-person-pvp prevention)
#This will block hitting with impossible angles.
#(blocks hitting behind yourself)
#This is pretty basic and will not cause false
#positives or false alerts.
#This also communicates with Heuristics. (Even when disabled.)
#Do you want to enable Angle?

   Angle: true

#Advanced KillAura Heuristics And Detection
#This is an advanced algorithm to catch a lot more
#combat hacks. This is generally aggersive, but
#you can make it even more aggressive or rather
#permissive, but i recommend leaving it as it is.
#How strong should Heuristics be configured?
#
# 0 = DISABLE
# 1 = PERMISSIVE
# 2 = NORMAL
# 3 = AGGRESSIVE
#
# PREMISSIVE will cause close to zero false positives
# even on large servers, but detection is slow and
# bypasses are more likely.
#
# NORMAL will catch most KillAuras, with a very little
# chanche of both false positives and negatives.
# I would recommand this setting because it is the most
# efficent and has the most usability.
#
# AGGRESSIVE will catch nearly every KillAura very fast,
# even some triggerbots are detected. This configuration is
# very agressive and may cause false positives depending
# on the situation. If you set "KillAura-Threshold" to
# 45 it can be very effective. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
#
#I reccomand to use PERMISSIVE if you have a big server.
#For other servers, use NORMAL for a normal server , only
#use AGGRESSIVE if you have a smaller server or massive
#problems with KillAura hackers.

   Heuristics: 2

#DeepHeuristics (Triggerbot/Advanced Aura Detection)
#This catches combat hacks that actually aim 
#on a Player. Disabeling this could make the check
#pretty easy to bypass.
#Advanced behavorial analysis of a players combat.
#This is a component of Heuristics you can configure.
#This will NOT work if Heuristics are disabled!
#
# 0 = DISABLE
# 1 = PERMISSIVE
# 2 = NORMAL
# 3 = AGGRESSIVE
#
# PERMISSIVE and NORMAL will catch some Macros and helps the KillAura
# Check to perform better. Generally NORMAL catches more hacks whilst
# PERMISSIVE gives almost zero False Alarms, it is still your choice.
# Works best with Heuristics set to PREMISSIVE or NORMAL.
#
# AGGRESSIVE is pretty paranoid and will catch nearly every combat hack in existance,
# but should be used with high thresholds. False Alarms much more likely.
# Works best with Heuristics set to AGGRESSIVE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
#
#I would recommend to use AGGRESSIVE if you have many hackers,
#for any other case use NORMAL.
#Only use PERMISSIVE if you get False Detections with NORMAL.

   DeepHeuristics: 2

#AimbotCatcher
#This is and old mechanisim to catch aimaura and aimbots in
#general. It is known for causing a lot of false alerts
#on windows 10 edition. it will work on MCPE but
#it is a risk to activate it. I would NOT recommend to
#enable this. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

   AimbotCatcher: false

#How many times must a player hack before detection?
#35 Should work fine. (Standard)
#NEVER set this lower than 25
#Optimal settings:
#For PREMISSIVE Heuristics: 25-30
#For   NORMAL   Heuristics: 35-40
#For AGGRESSIVE Heuristics: 45-50
#ALWAYS SET TO AT LEAST 40 IF USING AGGRESSIVE Heuristics!
#Increase if KillAura causes false poitives.

#False Positives.
#It simply mitigates an exploit in the game.
#Standard: 4.0
